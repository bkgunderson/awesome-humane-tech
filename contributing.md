# Contribution Guidelines

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Code projects must be open source and have a [FSF-approved](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html) license.
- Suggested entries should refer to tested and documented code
- Projects should be relevant to the topic and (preferably) under active development.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- New categories, or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- Keep descriptions short and simple, but descriptive.
- End all descriptions with a full stop/period.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.

Markdown format to use for new entries (see existing examples):

- If there is only a repository, use the following format: `[NAME](REPO-LINK) - DESCRIPTION.`
- If there is a website and a repository, use the following format: `[NAME](WEBSITE-LINK) | [GITHUB-ICON](REPO-LINK) - DESCRIPTION`
  - Use the appropriate icon i.e.`github.svg`, `gitlab.svg`. `gitea.svg` or `sourcehut.svg`.

Thank you for your suggestions!

## Updating your Pull Request

Sometimes, a maintainer of an awesome list will ask you to edit your Pull Request before it is included. This is normally due to spelling errors or because your PR didn't match the awesome-* list guidelines.

[Here](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md) is a write up on how to change a Pull Request, and the different ways you can do that.
